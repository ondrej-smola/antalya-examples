# Installing AWS EKS using terraform

This directory shows how to use the Altinity 
[terraform-aws-eks-clickhouse](https://github.com/Altinity/terraform-aws-eks-clickhouse)
module to stand up an EKS cluster. 

## Description

The main.tf sets up an EKS cluster in a single AZ. The cluster has 
3 node groups. 

* clickhouse - VMs for ClickHouse permanent nodes
* clickhouse-swarm - VMs for ClickHouse swarm nodes
* system - VMs for system nodes including ClickHouse Keeper

You can extend the example to multiple AZs by uncommenting code lines
appropriately. 

## Installation

1. Copy the module file from the terraform project to file main.tf.
2. Update the region and any other parameters you wish to change. 
3. Follow the installation instructions. Typical commands are shown below. 

```
terraform init
terraform apply
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name my-eks-cluster
```

## Trouble-shooting

Use aws eks commands to check configuration of the deployed cluster. 
Here's how to see available EKS clusters in the region. 

```
aws eks list-clusters
```

Show the node groups in a single cluster. 

```
aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster=my-eks-cluster
```

Show the details of a node group. Helpful to ensure you have auto-scaling 
limits set correctly. 
```
aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster=my-eks-cluster \
 --nodegroup=clickhouse-20250224214119166800000016
```
